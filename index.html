            <h3 class = "work--title">Make It Stick</h3>
            <div class = "justify-content-center">
              <p class = "work--description">
                MakeItStick is an organizer, its main objective is to categorize tasks/todos in logical way. The general structure of a project is a tree design where every element (todos or categories) will have a unique father, but each father could have endless children. The project will count on two basic elements “todos and categories”. The categories are the container that will bear the todos or other categories called “subcategories”. On the other, the todos will have a particular father category and also features like levels of importance and tags, that will help to share concepts with other todos and help the search of the todos.
                This project was built with the well-known TodoList Project in mind. The wireframe and general design were built using tools like <span class = "work--skill">Adobe Photoshop</span>, <span class = "work--skill">Adobe Illustrator</span> and <span class = "work--skill">Balsamiq</span>.</p>
                <p class = "work--description">The second part was the database schema with <span class = "work--skill">mySQL</span>. There were created 5 tables (users, collections, todos, tags, todo_tag) with their corresponding relationships:</p>

                </div>

                <p class = "work--description">Then was created the routes architecture for the project using <span class = "work--skill">PHP</span> and <span class = "work--skill">PHP-Object-Oriented</span>:</p>
                <div class = "work--extra">
                  <img src = "./inc/URL-Architecture.svg" alt = "url-architecture MakeItStick" />
                </div>
                <p class = "work--description">At the forth stage of the project, when the backend was already working, the styles were added using <span class = "work--skill">Sass</span> preprocessor and <span class = "work--skill">Bootstrap library.</span>
                At the last stage, was added all the different user interactions via <span class = "work--skill">JavaScript</span> and <span class = "work--skill">jQuery</span> and the element menu, one of the most interesting features of the project, which permit the interaction with a particular element (todo or category) to be deleted, created, moved or edited <span class = "work--skill">[CRUD]</span>. Almost all of the interactions were powered by <span class = "work--skill">AJAX</span> requests and <span class = "work--skill">PHP</span> calls.
                The project also contains a search form, that could filter results based on category name, todo name or tag name; all accomplished with <span class = "work--skill">PHP</span> and <span class = "work--skill">SQL</span>. And the last feature that was added was the registration form which permit to create and control new users for the application.</p>

              for a year and half in my country, Cuba, before coming to America. Once I got here I kept studying in the same field, but as a
              self-learned, all the subjects I could find related with web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Jquery, SASS, PHP, WordPress,
              Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Git and SQL. I loved the process of learning new things by myself and I also found it
              extremely useful for everything else I could be doing in my life. I am currently studying at Miami Dade College a major in Physics.</p>
            <p class = "section--description section--description-oposite"> One of my hobbies is languages, I am now in love with Italian.
              In the future I would like to get around some php frameworks like Laravel or javascript frameworks like react or angular;
              also calls my attention Big Data and Machine Learning.</p>
